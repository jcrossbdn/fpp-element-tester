Falcon Pi Player Element Tester

This plugin will pull information from an XML file (generated by your sequencing software) and present it for element level testing.

Format of the XML:

\<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?\>\n
\<SequencerName\>\n
  \<physical\>\n
    \<outputs\>\n
      \<output\n 
              oid="[unique #]"\n
              name="[Name of Channel]"\n
              r="x"   [OPTIONAL where r=red color and x=physical channel output number]\n
              g="x"   [OPTIONAL where g=green color and x=physical channel output number]\n
              b="x"   [OPTIONAL where b=blue color and x=physical channel output number]\n
              w="x"   [OPTIONAL where w=white color and x=physical channel output number]\n
      /\>\n
    \</outputs\>\n
  \</physical\>\n
  \n
  \<groups\>\n
    \<group name="[group name]"\>\n
      \<group name="[group name]"\>\n
      ...\n
        \<element name="[Element Name]" oid="[CSV of all physical/outputs that are part of this element]" /\>\n
      \</group\>\n
